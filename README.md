# Frogger-Game
This is my first big project.

I created a rudimentary version of the arcade game Frogger.

I created a frog class, a pod and a brick to represent the various objects in the game.

Used 'w', 'a', 's' , 'd' keys to control frog.  Try to avoid the bricks.  Each time you hit a pod
you get a point and it turns grey and you can't hit it again until you get the others.

Three lives--Good Luck!
